1. <b><code>Boid</code></b> - This class incorporates the flying behaviour of the boids and their movement.
2. <b><code>Flock</code></b> - This class acts as a controlling instance that creates and updates the boid instances.
3. <b><code>Animator</code></b> - This class incorporates the plotting and animation behaviour.
